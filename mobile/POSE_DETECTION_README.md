# Real-Time Pose Detection Integration

## Overview
This implementation integrates TensorFlow.js pose detection into the React Native fitness app, enabling real-time exercise analysis and rep counting.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Pose Detection Service (`src/services/PoseDetectionService.ts`)
- **Real-time pose estimation** using TensorFlow.js MoveNet model
- **Exercise analysis** for squats, push-ups, bicep curls, and jumping jacks
- **Rep counting** based on joint angle analysis
- **Form scoring** with real-time feedback
- **Performance optimization** for mobile devices (targeting 30+ FPS)

### 2. Pose Overlay Component (`src/components/PoseOverlay.tsx`)
- **Skeletal visualization** with colored keypoints
- **Camera orientation support** (front/back camera)
- **Confidence-based rendering** (only shows high-confidence keypoints)
- **Color-coded body parts** (face: yellow, arms: orange, legs: blue)

### 3. Enhanced Camera Screen (`src/screens/CameraScreen.tsx`)
- **Real-time pose detection** during workout recording
- **Exercise-specific analysis** with instant feedback
- **Performance monitoring** (FPS display)
- **Pose overlay toggle** for better user experience
- **Form scoring** and exercise phase detection

### 4. Frame Capture Utility (`src/utils/frameCapture.ts`)
- **Optimized frame extraction** from camera feed
- **Performance throttling** to maintain smooth operation
- **Mock data generation** for development/testing

## Key Body Landmarks Extracted
- **Shoulders**: left_shoulder, right_shoulder
- **Elbows**: left_elbow, right_elbow  
- **Wrists**: left_wrist, right_wrist
- **Hips**: left_hip, right_hip
- **Knees**: left_knee, right_knee
- **Ankles**: left_ankle, right_ankle

## Exercise Analysis

### Squats
- **Knee angle calculation** for depth measurement
- **Rep detection** based on up/down phases
- **Form feedback**: depth analysis, knee alignment
- **Scoring**: based on depth and symmetry

### Push-ups
- **Elbow angle calculation** for range of motion
- **Rep detection** based on arm extension/flexion
- **Form feedback**: range of motion, body alignment
- **Scoring**: based on depth and consistency

### Bicep Curls & Jumping Jacks
- **Framework ready** for implementation
- **Extensible architecture** for additional exercises

## Performance Optimizations

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- **MoveNet Lightning model** for speed
- **Frame processing throttling** (~30 FPS)
- **Tensor cleanup** to prevent memory leaks
- **Confidence thresholds** to filter noise
- **Processing queue** to handle frame backlog

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time FPS display**
- **Processing time tracking**
- **Performance warnings** for slow frames

2. **AI Status Indicator** shows "AI Ready" when pose detection is initialized
3. **Select Exercise Type** (Squats, Push-ups, etc.) from the dropdown
4. **Toggle Pose Overlay** using the eye icon to show/hide skeleton
5. **Start Recording** to begin exercise analysis
6. **Real-time Feedback**:
   - Rep counter updates automatically
   - Form score displayed (0-100%)
   - Feedback messages appear
   - Skeletal overlay shows body pose
7. **Performance Monitor** shows FPS in real-time

### Demo Features
- **Animated skeleton** demonstrates pose detection capability
- **Mock exercise analysis** shows rep counting and form scoring
- **Real-time performance** metrics (FPS display)
- **Exercise switching** between different workout types
